# Hollow Cathode Visualization 

## Motivation
#### -The project was created in intent to fullfill the Arizona State University Software Engineering capstone I (SER 401) and Capstone II (SER 402) requirements.
#### -The project familiarizes professional outside the field as well as the general public with hollow cathodes.
#### -The work reflects the team of four contributors and the demonstration of the hollow cathode effect.

## Features
#### -This project features a three dimensional model of the Hollow Cathode and distributes a user interaction with such device.

## Open Source Frameworks
#### -Blender: An open-source three dimensional computer graphics software toolset used for creaing three dimensional printable models and motion graphics.
#### -Sketchfab: An open-source three dimensional platform providing users to display three dimensional models based on WebGL and WebXR technologies.

## Languages
#### -HTML: Hypertext Markup Language is the standard markup language for documents designed, displayed and structured in a web browser.
#### -CSS: Cascade Style Sheets presents and describes the documents written in HTML and elements rendered on a screen.
#### -JS: Javascript is a text based programming language which allows you to make interactive web pages. 

## How to Use
#### -Any user will be able to access the content and model interaction provided the website URL.
#### -Any desktop or labtop with internet access shall be able to access and enable the three dimensional featured displayed. 

## Setup, Tools and Installation
